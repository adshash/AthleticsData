# Athletics Data Analysis and Visualisation 

This is a segment from a data analysis and visualisation project that I was tasked with at the University of Surrey as a part of the mathematical programming and professional skills module. I was a part of Group Iota, a team of 7 members tasked with producing a gantt chart, data analysis, simulation and report on athletics data. The repo here is limited to the parts I created/ helped to create, namely the gantt chart as well as the bulk of the data analysis and visualtion. 

I created polynomial regressions, scatter graphs & comparison functions for the athletics data sheet provided for various events across gender.

lines 332 - 511 were created by another individual from the group project BEN RASMUSSEN. The rest was created and is owned by Adil Hashlamon.
